    "Welcome to the second Frequentist inference mini-project! Over the course of working on this mini-project and the previous frequentist mini-project, you'll learn the fundamental concepts associated with frequentist inference. The following list includes the topics you will become familiar with as you work through these two mini-projects:\n",
    "* the _z_-statistic\n",
    "* the _t_-statistic\n",
    "* the difference and relationship between the two\n",
    "* the Central Limit Theorem, its assumptions and consequences\n",
    "* how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample\n",
    "* the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean\n",
    "* how to combine these concepts to calculate confidence intervals and p-values\n",
    "* how those confidence intervals and p-values allow you to perform hypothesis (or A/B) tests"

    "Imagine that a hospital has hired you as their data analyst. An administrator is working on the hospital's business operations plan and needs you to help them answer some business questions. This mini-project, as well as the bootstrap and Bayesian inference mini-projects also found in this unit are designed to illustrate how each of the inferential statistics methods have their uses for different use cases. In this assignment notebook, you're going to use frequentist statistical inference on a data sample to answer the questions:\n",
    "* has the hospital's revenue stream fallen below a key threshold?\n",
    "* are patients with insurance really charged different amounts than those without?\n",
    "Answering that last question with a frequentist approach makes some assumptions, or requires some knowledge, about the two groups. In the next mini-project, you'll use bootstrapping to test that assumption. And in the final mini-project of the unit, you're going to create a model for simulating _individual_ charges (not a sampling distribution) that the hospital can use to model a range of scenarios."

    "We are going to use some data on medical charges obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/easonlai/sample-insurance-claim-prediction-dataset). For the purposes of this exercise, assume the observations are the result of random sampling from our one hospital. Recall in the previous assignment, we introduced the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and how it tells us that the distributions of sample statistics approach a normal distribution as $n$ increases. The amazing thing about this is that it applies to the sampling distributions of statistics that have been calculated from even highly non-normal distributions of data. Remember, also, that hypothesis testing is very much based on making inferences about such sample statistics. You're going to rely heavily on the CLT to apply frequentist (parametric) tests to answer the questions in this notebook."

    ">__A:__ Since the medical charges sample data is very skewed to the left, i.e. positively skewed, the charges' mean and standard deviation do not give a good representation as to how the sample is distributed; just by looking at the mean and the standard deviation we cannot tell the skewness of the sample charge data which can be seen from plotting its histogram. If we try to understand the charge data solely on the obtained sample mean and statistic, those statistics would say that there is a significant probability that the client would get paid to come in for a visit; -2 standard deviations say that a client would get paid about $10,949.60 for a visit."

On the assumption that these data represent a random sample of charges, how would you justify that these data allow you to answer that question? And what would be the most appropriate frequentist test, of the ones discussed so far, to apply?"

    ">__A:__ In order to answer these questions using the frequentist approach, we are going to need the CLT's assumptions to be met; the two main considerations for the CLT to work are that the sample is independent and identically distributed. A sample is classified as independent if the sample was taken randomly without replacement and constitutes less than 10% of the population size; given that our sample has 1,338 client visits, we can assume that that is less than 10% of the total visits the hospital has seen, and we have been told that the observations we have were randomly selected. Therefore, the independent aspect of the CLT is met. In terms of the sample being identically distributed, it simply means that a single observation is being statistically analyzed with the same distribution containing that observation. Because both of the CLT conditions are met, we can use its statistical methods to answer the questions being asked with the given data. Further, when deciding what frequentist test to use, we have to look at the requirements of each; the two frequentist tests we have looked at so far use either the z-score or the t-score. Whenever we know the population's standard deviation, i.e. population parameter, and have a large sample size, usually 30+ samples, we can use the z-score, but when one of those two requirements are not met, we have to use the t-score; since we do not know the population parameter, we will be using the t-score to conduct the frequentist tests."
